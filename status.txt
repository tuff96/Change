>Intelligence
    A measure of a character's problem-solving ability. Intelligence often controls a character's ability to comprehend foreign languages and their skill 
	in magic.In some cases, intelligence controls how many skill points the character gets at "level up". In some games, it controls the rate at which 
	experience points are earned, or the amount needed to level up. Under certain circumstances, this skill can also negate combat actions between players
	and NPC enemies. This is sometimes combined with wisdom and/or willpower.
>Charisma

	Under certain circumstances, this skill can negate combat actions between players and NPC enemies.

	combine willpower and wisdom.

	influence combat sequence, or the accuracy of ranged attacks. Perception-type attributes are more common in more modern games. Note that this skill is
	usually understood only to apply to what a character can perceive with their established senses (ie sight, sound, smell, etc), and does not usually include
	extrasensory perception or other forms of mental telepathy or telekinesis in the given game unless the character's specific attributes expressly include 
	such abilities (such as the force in Star Wars). Sometimes combined with wisdom.
